        <h1>Getting Ready</h1>
        <p>For this recipe, we need the following ingredients:</p>
        <ul id="Getting Ready">                      
            <li>An Arduino board connected to the computer via USB</li>
            <li>A breadboard and jumper wires</li>
            <li>A regular LED (the typical LED size is 3 mm)</li>
            <li>A resistor between 220â€“1,000 ohm</li>                                                       
           </ul>

      <h1>How To Do It</h1>
      <p>Follow these steps to connect an external LED to an Arduino board:</p>  
        <ol id="How To Do It">          
          <li>Mount the resistor on the breadboard. Connect one end of the resistor to a digital
    pin on the Arduino board using a jumper wire.</li>
          <li>Mount the LED on the breadboard. Connect the anode (+) pin of the LED to the
    available pin on the resistor. We can determine the anode on the LED in two ways.
    Usually, the longer pin is the anode. Another way is to look for the flat edge on the
    outer casing of the LED. The pin next to the flat edge is the cathode (-).</li>
          <li>Connect the LED cathode (-) to the Arduino GND using jumper wires.</li>

         <h2>Code</h2>          
            <p>The following code will make the external LED blink:</p>           
            <li>// Declare the LED pin int LED = 2;</li>
            <li>void setup() { 
             // Declare the pin for the LED as Output pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
             }</li>
            <li>void loop(){
             // Here we will turn the LED ON and wait 200 milliseconds digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
             delay(200);
             // Here we will turn the LED OFF and wait 200 milliseconds digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
             delay(200);

        <h2>HELPFUL NOTE:</h2>
        <p>If the LED is connected to a different pin, simply change the LED value to
the value of the pin that has been used.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>This is all semiconductor magic. When the second digital pin is set to HIGH , the Arduino
provides 5 V of electricity, which travels through the resistor to the LED and GND. When
enough voltage and current is present, the LED will light up. The resistor limits the amount
of current passing through the LED. Without it, it is possible that the LED (or worse, the
Arduino pin) will burn. Try to avoid using LEDs without resistors; this can easily destroy the
LED or even your Arduino.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
        <p>The code simply turns the LED on, waits, and then turns it off again. Compared to the
previous recipe, in this one we will use a blocking approach by using the delay() function.
Here we declare the LED pin on digital pin 2:</p>
        <p>int LED = 2;</p>
        <p>In the setup() function we set the LED pin as an output:</p>
        <p> void setup() {
        pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
    }</p>
        <p>In the loop() function, we continuously turn the LED on, wait 200 milliseconds, and then
we turn it off. After turning it off we need to wait another 200 milliseconds, otherwise it will
instantaneously turn on again and we will only see a permanently on LED.</p>
        <p> void loop(){
    // Here we will turn the LED ON and wait 200 miliseconds
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
    delay(200);
    // Here we will turn the LED OFF and wait 200 miliseconds
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
    delay(200);
    }  </p>
